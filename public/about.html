<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Aniket Kumar Singh, a curious and driven learner with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and creative experimentation. I enjoy understanding how things work—from the logic behind code to the design choices that shape digital experiences. Whether it’s academics, projects, or self-learning, I like going deep into concepts instead of just skimming the surface.</p>

<p>My interests span across programming, web development, and emerging tech like AI tools and automation. I actively work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and core computer science fundamentals, and I’m continuously expanding my skill set through practice, virtual internships, and hands-on experimentation. I believe learning is most effective when theory meets real-world application.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I value consistency, curiosity, and adaptability. I enjoy exploring new ideas, refining my work, and pushing myself to improve a little every day. My goal is to grow into a well-rounded tech professional who not only writes efficient code but also thinks critically, communicates clearly, and builds meaningful solutions.</p>
